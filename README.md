# Chat-for-2-users
Application for conversation between two users.
Users have to enter a username before the chat could start.
Uses a terminal as "chat window".

Bugs :
  - while typing a message, if the other user sends a message, the output would be :
        "user1 : partOfYourMessage + user2 : user2's sent message"
